You are a cyber security engineer, SOC analyst, and cloud-aware system architect
designing a FIRST-SEMESTER academic project for the course
“Introduction to Cyber Security”.

Your task is to CREATE a COMPLETE, DEMONSTRABLE, SOC-LIKE PROJECT
with documentation and safe demonstration materials.

==================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
==================================================
Project Name:
Mini SOC – Cloud-Based Client–Server Cyber Monitoring System

This project simulates a simplified Security Operations Center (SOC) to demonstrate:
- Monitoring
- Logging
- Centralized visibility
- Basic detection and response

This is an EDUCATIONAL project only.

==================================================
ARCHITECTURE
==================================================
Client–Server model

--------------------------------------------------
CLIENT SIDE
--------------------------------------------------
- Runs on user machines
- Collects:
  - Recent downloads
  - Suspicious activities (rule-based or simulated)
- Sends logs to cloud server
- Accepts commands from server
- Executes demo actions:
  - Alert user
  - Stop suspicious process (simulation)
  - Shutdown (demo only)

--------------------------------------------------
SERVER SIDE (CLOUD DEPLOYED)
--------------------------------------------------
- Deployed on a FREE cloud platform:
  - Railway or Vercel (preferred)
  - Or suggest an easier free alternative if better
- Receives and stores client logs
- Hosts a WEB-BASED ADMIN PORTAL
- Single admin login
- Dashboard features:
  - Client list
  - Individual activity views
  - SOC-style logs and graphs
  - Remote action buttons

==================================================
SECURITY & SOC FEATURES (SIMPLIFIED)
==================================================
- Detect malicious links:
  - Static list OR free threat-intel API
- Block malicious links (demo level)
- Detect and stop known test malware samples
  (harmless and industry-accepted)
- Fetch SOC / cyber threat data from FREE APIs
- Display threat data on dashboard

==================================================
SAFE DEMONSTRATION MATERIALS (MANDATORY)
==================================================
Provide SAFE, EDUCATIONAL samples ONLY, such as:
- EICAR test string/file
- AMTSO malware test URLs
- Known phishing test domains (for demo)
- Clearly label them as “TEST / NON-HARMFUL”

DO NOT include real malware or live attack infrastructure.

==================================================
UI / UX DESIGN (VERY IMPORTANT)
==================================================
- Dark theme SOC dashboard
- Futuristic / cyber-defense aesthetic
- Panels, cards, charts, alerts
- “Sci-fi SOC” visual impression
- UI should look advanced even if backend is simple

==================================================
TECH STACK
==================================================
You decide:
- Languages
- Frameworks
- Database
- APIs

BUT:
- Must be FREE
- Easy to deploy on Railway or Vercel
- Easy to explain and demonstrate
- First-semester appropriate

==================================================
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT (.md FILE)
==================================================
Create a COMPLETE Markdown file that includes:

## Project Introduction
## Architecture Overview
## Installation & Setup
## Cloud Deployment Steps
## How to Run Client & Server
## Admin Portal Usage
## Demonstration Guide
- Step-by-step demo flow
- Commands to run
- Buttons to click
- Expected output

## Sample Malware & Malicious Links Used
- Explain why they are safe
- How they trigger detection

## Incident Response Demonstration
## Limitations
## Ethical Disclaimer
## Conclusion

==================================================
DELIVERABLES
==================================================
1. Client application
2. Cloud-deployed server
3. Admin dashboard
4. Client-server communication
5. SOC-style graphs
6. Remote control actions
7. Safe demo samples
8. Complete `.md` usage & demo guide
9. Deployment instructions

==================================================
IMPORTANT RULES
==================================================
- No real malware
- No real exploitation
- Educational simulation only
- No exaggerated claims
- Ethical, academic focus
- Clean, explainable code

==================================================
FINAL GOAL
==================================================
The project should:
- Look like a real SOC platform
- Be cloud deployed
- Impress evaluators visually
- Demonstrate core cyber security concepts
- Be easy to run, explain, and demonstrate live
